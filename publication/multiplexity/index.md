abstract: Multivariate networks comprising several compositional and structural variables
  can be represented as multigraphs by various forms of aggregations based on vertex
  attributes. We propose a framework to perform exploratory and confirmatory multiplexity
  analysis of aggregated multigraphs in order to find relevant associations between
  vertex and edge attributes. The exploration is performed by comparing frequencies
  of the different edges within and between aggregated vertex categories, while the
  confirmatory analysis is performed using derived complexity or multiplexity statistics
  under different random multigraph models. These statistics are defined by the distribution
  of edge multiplicities and provide information on the covariation and dependencies
  of different edges given vertex attributes. The presented approach highlights the
  need to further analyse and model structural dependencies with respect to edge entrainment.
  We illustrate the approach by applying it on a well known multivariate network dataset
  which has previously been analysed in the context of multiplexity.
