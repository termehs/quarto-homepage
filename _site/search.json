    "text": "Abstract\nModel-based reconstruction is an approach to infer network structures where they cannot be observed. For archaeological networks, several models based on assumptions concerning distance among sites, site size, or costs and benefits have been proposed to infer missing ties. Since these assumptions are formulated at a dyadic level, they do not provide means to express dependencies among ties and therefore include less plausible network scenarios. In this paper we investigate the use of network models that explicitly incorporate tie dependence. In particular, we consider exponential random graph models, and show how they can be applied to reconstruct networks coherent with Burt’s arguments on closure and structural holes (Burt 2001). The approach is illustrated on data from the Middle Bronze Age in the Aegean. authors:\nJournal of Archaeological Method and Theory 25(1), 226-253"

    "text": "Abstract\nMultivariate networks comprising several compositional and structural variables can be represented as multigraphs by various forms of aggregations based on vertex attributes. We propose a framework to perform exploratory and confirmatory multiplexity analysis of aggregated multigraphs in order to find relevant associations between vertex and edge attributes. The exploration is performed by comparing frequencies of the different edges within and between aggregated vertex categories, while the confirmatory analysis is performed using derived complexity or multiplexity statistics under different random multigraph models. These statistics are defined by the distribution of edge multiplicities and provide information on the covariation and dependencies of different edges given vertex attributes. The presented approach highlights the need to further analyse and model structural dependencies with respect to edge entrainment. We illustrate the approach by applying it on a well known multivariate network dataset which has previously been analysed in the context of multiplexity.\npublication: Statistical Methods & Applications 30, 1425–1444"

The first model is random stub matching given fixed degrees (RSM) so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent, and the second is independent edge assignments (IEA) according to a common probability distribution. Tests are performed using goodness of fit measures between the edge multiplicity sequence of an observed multigraph, and the expected one according to a simple or composite hypothesis. Test statistics of Pearson type and of likelihood ratio type are used, and the expected values of the Pearson statistic under the different models are derived. Test performances based on simulations indicate that even for small number of edges, the null distributions of both statistics are well approximated by their asymptotic χ2-distribution. The non-null distributions of the test statistics can be well approximated by proposed adjusted χ2-distributions used for power approximations. The influence of RSM on both test statistics is substantial for small number of edges and implies a shift of their distributions towards smaller values compared to what holds true for the null distributions under IEA. Two applications on social networks are included to illustrate how the tests can guide in the analysis of social structure.\nJournal of Applied Statistics"

It is investigated when this ignorance is justified so that the simplified model can be used as an approximation, thus facilitating the structural analysis of network data with multiple relations and loops.

The social systems arising exhibit patterns of interest, and social network analysis is the study of how and why these patterns emerge, sustain, and evolve. Of primary interest is thus to understand and describe the social processes that support the observed structure. These processes are founded in theories about network representation and theories about observed social phenomena. The benefit from network conceptualisation is thus obtained by outlining the association and distinction between these theories. This entry serves as an introduction to fundamental network concepts and analytical approaches, their potential for studying social phenomena, and a description of why they are central to theoretical constructs. This entry also provides a short introduction to statistical network modelling for cross-sectional and longitudinal network data.\nSAGE Research Methods Foundations"

In recent years, different approaches have been considered to offer data privacy to online social networks and for developing graph protection. Perturbative approaches are formally defined in terms of perturbation and modification of graphs. In this paper, we discuss the concept of P -stability on graphs and its relation to data privacy. The concept of P-stability is rooted in the number of graphs given a fixed degree sequence. In this paper, we show that for any graph there exists a class of P-stable graphs. This result implies that there is a fully polynomial randomized approximation for graph masking for the graphs in the class. In order to further refine the classification of a given graph, we introduce the concept of natural class of a graph. It is based on a class of scale-free networks.\nIEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing 4(3), 374-381"

More recently the development of large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (isoscapes) has contributed to improved geographic assignments of human and animal origins. Persistent challenges remain, however, in the accurate identification of individual geographic origins from skeletal isotope data in studies of human (and animal) migration and provenance. In an attempt to develop and test more standardized and quantitative approaches to geographic assignment of individual origins using isotopic data two methods, combining 87Sr/86Sr and d18O isoscapes, are examined for the Circum-Caribbean region 1) an Interval approach using a defined range of fixed isotopic variation per location and 2) a Likelihood assignment approach using univariate and bivariate probability density functions. These two methods are tested with enamel isotope data from a modern sample of known origin from Caracas, Venezuela and further explored with two archaeological samples of unknown origin recovered from Cuba and Trinidad. The results emphasize both the potential and limitation of the different approaches. Validation tests on the known origin sample exclude most areas of the Circum-Caribbean region and correctly highlight Caracas as a possible place of origin with both approaches. The positive validation results clearly demonstrate the overall efficacy of a dual-isotope approach to geoprovenance. The accuracy and precision of geographic assignments may be further improved by better understanding of the relationships between environmental and biological isotope variation; continued development and refinement of relevant isoscapes; and the eventual incorporation of a broader array of isotope proxy data.\nPLoS ONE 12(2), e0172562"

In northern Iroquoia, late pre-contact pottery and early contact decoration commonly occur on collars—thick bands of clay that encircle a pot and extend several centimeters down from the lip. These decorations constitute signals that conveyed information about a pot’s user(s). In southern Ontario the period A.D. 1350 to 1650 witnessed substantial changes in socio-political and settlement systems that included population movement, coalescence of formerly separate communities into large villages and towns, waxing and waning of regional strife, the formation of nations, and finally the development of three confederacies that each occupied distinct, constricted areas. Social network analysis demonstrates that signaling practices changed to reflect these regional patterns. Networks become more consolidated through time ultimately resulting in a “small world” network with small degrees of separation between sites reflecting the integration of communities within and between the three confederacies.\nPLoS ONE 11(5), e0156178"

    "text": "In multivariate statistics, there is an abundance of different measures of centrality and spread, many of which cannot be applied on variables measured on nominal or ordinal scale. Since network data in majority comprises such variables, alternative measures for analyzing spread, flatness and association is needed. This is also of particular relevance given the special feature of interdependent observations in networks.\nMultivariate entropy analysis is a general statistical method for analyzing and finding dependence structure in data consisting of repeated observations of variables with a common domain and with discrete finite range spaces. Only nominal scale is required for each variable, so only the size of the variable’s range space is important but not its actual values. Variables on ordinal or numerical scales, even continuous numerical scales, can be used, but they should be aggregated so that their ranges match the number of available repeated observations. By investigating the frequencies of occurrences of joint variable outcomes, complicated dependence structures, partial independence and conditional independence as well as redundancies and functional dependence can be found.\nSince 2015, I am working with Ove Frank and Krzysztof Nowicki on a project in which we build a systematic framework for using statistical entropy tools to analyze network data. A forthcoming monograph on the topic is expected in the coming year.\nThe proposed framework is implemented in the R package ‘netropy’ and a description of various functions implemented in the package are given in the following. More details are provided in the package vignettes and the references listed."

    "text": "Variable domains and data editing\nA requirement for the applicability of these entropy tools is the specification of discrete variables with finite range spaces on the same domain: either node attributes/vertex variables, edges/dyad variables or triad variables. These can be either observed or transformed as shown in the following using the above example data set.\nWe have 8 vertex variables with 71 observations, two of which (years and age) are numerical and needs categorization based on their cumulative distributions. This categorization is in details described in the vignette “variable domains and data editing”. Here we just show the new dataframe created (note that variable senior is omitted as it only comprises unique values and that we edit all variable to start from 0):\n\natt.var <-\n  data.frame(\n    status   = df.att$status-1,\n    gender   = df.att$gender,\n    office   = df.att$office-1,\n    years    = ifelse(df.att$years <= 3,0,\n                      ifelse(df.att$years <= 13,1,2)),\n    age      = ifelse(df.att$age <= 35,0,\n                      ifelse(df.att$age <= 45,1,2)),\n    practice = df.att$practice,\n    lawschool= df.att$lawschool-1\n    )\nhead(att.var)\n\n  status gender office years age practice lawschool\n1      0      1      0     2   2        1         0\n2      0      1      0     2   2        0         0\n3      0      1      1     1   2        1         0\n4      0      1      0     2   2        0         2\n5      0      1      1     2   2        1         1\n6      0      1      1     2   2        1         0\n\n\nThese vertex variables can be transformed into dyad variables by using the function get_dyad_var(). Observed node attributes in the dataframe att_var are then transformed into pairs of individual attributes. For example, status with binary outcomes is transformed into dyads having 4 possible outcomes (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1):\n\ndyad.status    <- get_dyad_var(att.var$status, type = 'att')\ndyad.gender    <- get_dyad_var(att.var$gender, type = 'att')\ndyad.office    <- get_dyad_var(att.var$office, type = 'att')\ndyad.years     <- get_dyad_var(att.var$years, type = 'att')\ndyad.age       <- get_dyad_var(att.var$age, type = 'att')\ndyad.practice  <- get_dyad_var(att.var$practice, type = 'att')\ndyad.lawschool <- get_dyad_var(att.var$lawschool, type = 'att')\n\nSimilarly, dyad variables can be created based on observed ties. For the undirected edges, we use indicator variables read directly from the adjacency matrix for the dyad in question, while for the directed ones (advice and friendship) we have pairs of indicators representing sending and receiving ties with 4 possible outcomes :\n\ndyad.cwk    <- get_dyad_var(adj.cowork, type = 'tie')\ndyad.adv    <- get_dyad_var(adj.advice, type = 'tie')\ndyad.frn    <- get_dyad_var(adj.friend, type = 'tie')\n\nAll 10 dyad variables are merged into one data frame for subsequent entropy analysis:\n\ndyad.var <-\n  data.frame(cbind(status   = dyad.status$var,\n                  gender    = dyad.gender$var,\n                  office    = dyad.office$var,\n                  years     = dyad.years$var,\n                  age       = dyad.age$var,\n                  practice  = dyad.practice$var,\n                  lawschool = dyad.lawschool$var,\n                  cowork    = dyad.cwk$var,\n                  advice    = dyad.adv$var,\n                  friend    = dyad.frn$var)\n                  )\nhead(dyad.var)\n\n  status gender office years age practice lawschool cowork advice friend\n1      3      3      0     8   8        1         0      0      3      2\n2      3      3      3     5   8        3         0      0      0      0\n3      3      3      3     5   8        2         0      0      1      0\n4      3      3      0     8   8        1         6      0      1      2\n5      3      3      0     8   8        0         6      0      1      1\n6      3      3      1     7   8        1         6      0      1      1\n\n\nA similar function get_triad_var() is implemented for transforming vertex variables and different relation types into triad variables. This is described in more detail in the vignette “variable domains and data editing”."

This occurs when the univariate entropy for a variable is equal to the bivariate entropies for pairs including that variable. As seen above, the dataframe dyad.var has no redundant variables. This can also be checked using the function redundancy() which yields a binary matrix as output indicating which row and column variables are hold the same information:\n\nredundancy(dyad.var)\n\nNULL\n\n\nMore examples of using the function redundancy() is given in the vignette “univariate bivariate and trivariate entropies”.\nTrivariate entropies can be computed using the function entropy_trivar() which returns a dataframe with the first three columns representing possible triples of variables V1,V2, and V3 from the dataframe in question, and their entropies H(V1,V2,V3) as the fourth column. We illustrated this on the dataframe dyad.var:\n\nH3 <- entropy_trivar(dyad.var)\nhead(H3, 10) # view first 10 rows of dataframe\n\n       V1     V2        V3 H(V1,V2,V3)\n1  status gender    office       4.938\n2  status gender     years       4.609\n3  status gender       age       5.129\n4  status gender  practice       4.810\n5  status gender lawschool       5.664\n6  status gender    cowork       3.464\n7  status gender    advice       4.048\n8  status gender    friend       3.685\n9  status office     years       5.321\n10 status office       age       5.721"

We have independence (joint entropy value of 0) between two pairs of variables: (status,practice), (practise,gender), (cowork,gender),and (cowork,lawschool).\nThese results can be illustrated in a association graph using the function assoc_graph() which returns a ggraph object in which nodes represent variables and links represent strength of association (thicker links indicate stronger dependence). To use the function we need to load the ggraph library and to determine a threshold which the graph drawn is based on. We set it to 0.15 so that we only visualize the strongest associations\n\nlibrary(ggraph)\nassoc_graph(dyad.var, 0.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this threshold, we see isolated and disconnected nodes representing independent variables. We note strong dependence between the three dyadic variables status,years and age, but also a somewhat strong dependence among the three variables lawschool, years and age, and the three variables status, years and gender. The association graph can also be interpreted as a tendency for relations cowork and friend to be independent conditionally on relation advice, that is, any dependence between dyad variables cowork and friend is explained by advice.\nA threshold that gives a graph with reasonably many small independent or conditionally independent subsets of variables can be considered to represent a multivariate model for further testing.\nMore details and examples of joint entropies and association graphs are given in the vignette “joint entropies and association graphs”."

These data structures can be either directly observed or aggregated by classifying or cross-classifying node attributes into meta nodes.

See example below where the original graph with 15 nodes and 12 edges (left) is aggregated based on node categories into a small multigraph with 4 nodes (right).\n\nEdge aggregation can also be used to obtain multigraphs. Assume that we study a graph with three different types of relations over three periods of time: \nIf we aggregate over time periods, we obtain for each edge category a multigraph for the total time period of three days:\n\nFor more details on these kinds of aggregations, see Shafie (2015;2016)."

The number of vertex pair sites is given by r = n(n+1)/2.\n\nRandom multigraph models\nTwo probability models for generating undirected random multigraphs are implemented in the package together with several statistics under these two models. Moreover, functions for goodness of fit tests are available for the presented models.\nNote that some of the functions are only practical for small scale multigraphs.\nThe first model is obtained by random stub matching (RSM) given observed degree sequence of a multigraphs, so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent. The second is obtained by independent edge assignments (IEA) according to a common probability distribution. There are two ways in which an approximate IEA model can be obtained from an RSM model, thus facilitating the structural analysis. These two ways are\n\nindependent stub assignment (ISA)\nindependent edge assignment of stubs (IEAS)\n\n(Shafie, 2016).\n\n\nExample\n\nlibrary('multigraphr')\n\nConsider a small graph on 3 nodes and the following adjacency matrix:\n\nA <-  matrix(c(1, 1, 0, \n               1, 2, 2, \n               0, 2, 0), \n             nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\nA\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    1    0\n[2,]    1    2    2\n[3,]    0    2    0\n\n\nThe degree sequence of the multigraph has double counted diagonals (edge stubs for loops) and is given by\n\nD <- get_degree_seq(adj = A, type = 'graph')\nD\n\n[1] 3 7 2\n\n\nso that number of edges in the multigraph is half the sum of the degree sequence which is equal to 6.\nThe RSM model given observed degree sequence shows the sample space consists of 7 possible multigraphs, as represented by their multiplicity sequence m.seq (each row correspond to the edge multiplicity sequence of a unique multigraph):\n\nrsm_1 <- rsm_model(deg.seq = D)\nrsm_1$m.seq\n\n  M11 M12 M13 M22 M23 M33\n1   1   1   0   3   0   1\n2   1   1   0   2   2   0\n3   1   0   1   3   1   0\n4   0   3   0   2   0   1\n5   0   3   0   1   2   0\n6   0   2   1   2   1   0\n7   0   1   2   3   0   0\n\n\nwith probabilities associated with each multigraph, together with statistics ‘number of loops’, ‘number of multiple edges’ and ‘simple graphs or not’:\n\nrsm_1$prob.dists\n\n    prob.rsm loops multiedges simple\n1 0.03030303     5          1      0\n2 0.18181818     3          3      0\n3 0.06060606     4          2      0\n4 0.06060606     3          3      0\n5 0.24242424     1          5      0\n6 0.36363636     2          4      0\n7 0.06060606     3          3      0\n\n\nConsider using the IEA model to approximate the RSM model so that edge assignment probabilities are functions of observed degree sequence. Note that the sample space for multigraphs is much bigger than for the RSM model so the multiplicity sequences are not printed (they can be found using the function get_edgemultip_seq for very small multigraphs and their probabilities can be found using the multinomial distribution).
