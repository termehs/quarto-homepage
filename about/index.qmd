<div class="habout">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I&rsquo;m  Termeh</div>
I'm a statistician with more than a decade of experience in developing methods and models to analyze multivariate social networks. I'm also the developer and maintainer of two R packages on the topic. 

Interdisciplinary applications are close to heart and I have had many such collaborations in different branches of computational social science and digital humanities. 
You can find information on some of the methodological and empirical projects that I have worked on or currently work on [here](/project/).
