Another option is the `LiblineaR` library, which is useful for very large linear problems.\n\n## Support Vector Classifier\n\nThe `e1071` library contains implementations for a number of statistical learning methods. In particular, the `svm()` function can be used to fit a support vector classifier when the argument `kernel = \"linear\"` is used.\n\nA `cost` argument allows us to specify the cost of a violation to the margin. When the `cost` argument is small, then the margins will be wide and many support vectors will be on the margin or will violate the margin. When the `cost` argument is large, then the margins will be narrow and there will be few support vectors on the margin or violating the margin.\n\nWe now use the `svm()` function to fit the support vector classifier for a given value of the `cost` parameter. Here we demonstrate the use of this function on a two-dimensional example so that we can plot the resulting decision boundary. We begin by generating the observations, which belong to two classes, and checking whether the classes are linearly separable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(e1071)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'plotly'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    last_plot\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:graphics':\n\n    layout\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\nx <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 2), ncol = 2)\ny <- c(rep(-1, 10), rep(1, 10))\nx[y == 1, ] <- x[y == 1, ] + 1\ndat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y))\n\ndat %>% ggplot(aes(x = x.2, y = x.1, color = y)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey are not. Next, we fit the support vector classifier.

The region of feature space that will be assigned to the $-1$ class is shown in light yellow, and the region that will be assigned to the $+1$ class is shown in red. The decision boundary between the two classes is linear (because we used the argument `kernel = \"linear\"`), though due to the way in which the plotting function is implemented in this library the decision boundary looks somewhat jagged in the plot. (Note that here the second feature is plotted on the $x$-axis and the first feature is plotted on the $y$-axis, in contrast to the behavior of the usual `plot()` function in `R`.) The support vectors are plotted as crosses and the remaining observations are plotted as circles; we see here that there are seven support vectors. We can determine their identities as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvmfit$index\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  1  2  5  7 14 16 17\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can obtain some basic information about the support vector classifier fit using the `summary()` command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(svmfit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nsvm(formula = y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", cost = 10, scale = FALSE)\n\n\nParameters:\n   SVM-Type:  C-classification \n SVM-Kernel:  linear \n       cost:  10 \n\nNumber of Support Vectors:  7\n\n ( 4 3 )\n\n\nNumber of Classes:  2 \n\nLevels: \n -1 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis tells us, for instance, that a linear kernel was used with `cost = 10`, and that there were seven support vectors, four in one class and three in the other.\n\nWhat if we instead used a smaller value of the cost parameter?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", \n    cost = 0.1, scale = FALSE)\nplot(svmfit, dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvmfit$index\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  7  9 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that a smaller value of the cost parameter is being used, we obtain a larger number of support vectors, because the margin is now wider. Unfortunately, the `svm()` function does not explicitly output the coefficients of the linear decision boundary obtained when the support vector classifier is fit, nor does it output the width of the margin.\n\nThe `e1071` library includes a built-in function, `tune()`, to perform cross-validation. By default, `tune()` performs ten-fold cross-validation on a set of models of interest. In order to use this function, we pass in relevant information about the set of models that are under consideration. The following command indicates that we want to compare SVMs with a linear kernel, using a range of values of the `cost` parameter.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\ntune.out <- tune(svm, y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", \n    ranges = list(cost = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can easily access the cross-validation errors for each of these models using the `summary()` command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(tune.out)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nParameter tuning of 'svm':\n\n- sampling method: 10-fold cross validation \n\n- best parameters:\n cost\n  0.1\n\n- best performance: 0.05 \n\n- Detailed performance results:\n   cost error dispersion\n1 1e-03  0.55  0.4377975\n2 1e-02  0.55  0.4377975\n3 1e-01  0.05  0.1581139\n4 1e+00  0.15  0.2415229\n5 5e+00  0.15  0.2415229\n6 1e+01  0.15  0.2415229\n7 1e+02  0.15  0.2415229\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that `cost = 0.1` results in the lowest cross-validation error rate.

However, we can see from the figure that the margin is very narrow (because the observations that are not support vectors, indicated as circles, are very close to the decision boundary).

It seems likely that this model will perform better on test data than the model with `cost = 1e5`.\n\n## Support Vector Machine\n\nIn order to fit an SVM using a non-linear kernel, we once again use the `svm()` function. However, now we use a different value of the parameter `kernel`. To fit an SVM with a polynomial kernel we use `kernel = \"polynomial\"`, and to fit an SVM with a radial kernel we use `kernel = \"radial\"`. In the former case we also use the `degree` argument to specify a degree for the polynomial kernel (this is $d$ in (9.22)), and in the latter case we use `gamma` to specify a value of $\\gamma$ for the radial basis kernel (9.24).\n\nWe first generate some data with a non-linear class boundary, as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\nx <- matrix(rnorm(200 * 2), ncol = 2)\nx[1:100, ] <- x[1:100, ] + 2\nx[101:150, ] <- x[101:150, ] - 2\ny <- c(rep(1, 150), rep(2, 50))\ndat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y))\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlotting the data makes it clear that the class boundary is indeed non-linear:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat %>% ggplot(aes(x = x.2, y = x.1, color = y)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data is randomly split into training and testing groups. We then fit the training data using the `svm()` function with a radial kernel and $\\gamma=1$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrain <- sample(200, 100)\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], kernel = \"radial\",  \n    gamma = 1, cost = 1)\nplot(svmfit, dat[train, ])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_boundary(dat[train,], svmfit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk18-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot shows that the resulting SVM has a decidedly non-linear boundary. The `summary()` function can be used to obtain some information about the SVM fit:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(svmfit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nsvm(formula = y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], kernel = \"radial\", gamma = 1, \n    cost = 1)\n\n\nParameters:\n   SVM-Type:  C-classification \n SVM-Kernel:  radial \n       cost:  1 \n\nNumber of Support Vectors:  31\n\n ( 16 15 )\n\n\nNumber of Classes:  2 \n\nLevels: \n 1 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see from the figure that there are a fair number of training errors in this SVM fit. If we increase the value of `cost`, we can reduce the number of training errors. However, this comes at the price of a more irregular decision boundary that seems to be at risk of overfitting the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], kernel = \"radial\", \n    gamma = 1, cost = 1e5)\nplot(svmfit, dat[train, ])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_boundary(dat[train,], svmfit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_SVM_files/figure-html/chunk20-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can perform cross-validation using `tune()` to select the best choice of $\\gamma$ and `cost` for an SVM with a radial kernel:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\ntune.out <- tune(svm, y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], \n    kernel = \"radial\", \n    ranges = list(\n      cost = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),\n      gamma = c(0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n    )\n  )\nsummary(tune.out)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nParameter tuning of 'svm':\n\n- sampling method: 10-fold cross validation \n\n- best parameters:\n cost gamma\n    1   0.5\n\n- best performance: 0.07 \n\n- Detailed performance results:\n    cost gamma error dispersion\n1  1e-01   0.5  0.26 0.15776213\n2  1e+00   0.5  0.07 0.08232726\n3  1e+01   0.5  0.07 0.08232726\n4  1e+02   0.5  0.14 0.15055453\n5  1e+03   0.5  0.11 0.07378648\n6  1e-01   1.0  0.22 0.16193277\n7  1e+00   1.0  0.07 0.08232726\n8  1e+01   1.0  0.09 0.07378648\n9  1e+02   1.0  0.12 0.12292726\n10 1e+03   1.0  0.11 0.11005049\n11 1e-01   2.0  0.27 0.15670212\n12 1e+00   2.0  0.07 0.08232726\n13 1e+01   2.0  0.11 0.07378648\n14 1e+02   2.0  0.12 0.13165612\n15 1e+03   2.0  0.16 0.13498971\n16 1e-01   3.0  0.27 0.15670212\n17 1e+00   3.0  0.07 0.08232726\n18 1e+01   3.0  0.08 0.07888106\n19 1e+02   3.0  0.13 0.14181365\n20 1e+03   3.0  0.15 0.13540064\n21 1e-01   4.0  0.27 0.15670212\n22 1e+00   4.0  0.07 0.08232726\n23 1e+01   4.0  0.09 0.07378648\n24 1e+02   4.0  0.13 0.14181365\n25 1e+03   4.0  0.15 0.13540064\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTherefore, the best choice of parameters involves `cost = 1` and `gamma = 0.5`. We can view the test set predictions for this model by applying the `predict()` function to the data. Notice that to do this we subset the dataframe `dat` using `-train` as an index set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(\n    true = dat[-train, \"y\"], \n    pred = predict(\n      tune.out$best.model, newdata = dat[-train, ]\n      )\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    pred\ntrue  1  2\n   1 67 10\n   2  2 21\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n$12 \\%$ of test observations are misclassified by this SVM.\n\n## ROC Curves\n\nThe `ROCR` package can be used to produce ROC curves such as those in Figures 9.10 and 9.11. We first write a short function to plot an ROC curve given a vector containing a numerical score for each observation, `pred`, and a vector containing the class label for each observation, `truth`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ROCR)\nrocplot <- function(pred, truth, ...) {\n  predob <- prediction(pred, truth)\n  perf <- performance(predob, \"tpr\", \"fpr\")\n  plot(perf, ...)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nSVMs and support vector classifiers output class labels for each observation. However, it is also possible to obtain *fitted values* for each observation, which are the numerical scores used to obtain the class labels. For instance, in the case of a support vector classifier, the fitted value for an observation $X= (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p)^T$ takes the form $\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_p X_p$. For an SVM with a non-linear kernel, the equation that yields the fitted value is given in (9.23). In essence, the sign of the fitted value determines on which side of the decision boundary the observation lies. Therefore, the relationship between the fitted value and the class prediction for a given observation is simple: if the fitted value exceeds zero then the observation is assigned to one class, and if it is less than zero then it is assigned to the other. In order to obtain the fitted values for a given SVM model fit, we use `decision.values = TRUE` when fitting `svm()`.
