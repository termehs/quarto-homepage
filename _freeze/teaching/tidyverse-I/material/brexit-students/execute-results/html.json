How is the story this visualisation telling different than the story the original plot tells? **Hint:** You'll need the **scales** package to improve axis labeling, which means you'll need to load it on top of the document as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code goes here\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 3 - Comparing proportions across bars\n\nRecreate the same visualisation from the previous exercise, this time dodging the bars for opinion proportions for each region, rather than faceting by region and then improve the legend.
