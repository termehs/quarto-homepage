Sometimes things will go swimmingly, and sometimes you’ll run into merge conflicts. So our first task today is to walk you through a merge conflict!\n\nPushing to a repo replaces the code on GitHub with the code you have on your computer.\nIf a collaborator has made a change to your repo on GitHub that you haven’t incorporated into your local work, GitHub will stop you from pushing to the repo because this could overwrite your collaborator’s work!\nSo you need to explicitly “merge” your collaborator’s work before you can push.\nIf your and your collaborator’s changes are in different files or in different parts of the same file, git merges the work for you automatically when you *pull*.\nIf you both changed the same part of a file, git will produce a **merge conflict** because it doesn’t know how which change you want to keep and which change you want to overwrite.\n\nGit will put conflict markers in your code that look like:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD \n\nSee also: [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)   \n\n======= \n\nSee also [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some1alpha2numeric3string4\nThe ===s separate your changes (top) from their changes (bottom).\nNote that on top you see the word HEAD, which indicates that these are your changes.\nAnd at the bottom you see some1alpha2numeric3string4 (well, it probably looks more like 28e7b2ceb39972085a0860892062810fb812a08f).\nThis is the hash (a unique identifier) of the commit your collaborator made with the conflicting change.\nYour job is to reconcile the changes: edit the file so that it incorporates the best of both versions and delete the &lt;&lt;&lt;, ===, and &gt;&gt;&gt; lines. Then you can stage and commit the result."

    "text": "Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes\n… says the Buzzfeed article. Let’s see if that’s true.\nFirst, we’ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. We’ll use the mutate() function for this. The following pipeline mutates the nobel_living data frame by adding a new variable called country_us. We use an if statement to create this variable. The first argument in the if_else() function we’re using to write this if statement is the condition we’re testing for. If country is equal to \"USA\", we set country_us to \"USA\". If not, we set the country_us to \"Other\".\n\nNote that we can achieve the same result using the `fct_other()` function we've seen before (i.e. with `country_us = fct_other(country, \"USA\")`). We decided to use the `if_else()` here to show you one example of an if statement in R.\n\n\nnobel_living &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\nnobel_living_science &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n\nFor the next exercise work with the nobel_living_science data frame you created above. This means you’ll need to define this data frame in your R Markdown document, even though the next exercise doesn’t explicitly ask you to do so.\n\nCreate a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize. Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\nYour visualization should be faceted by category.\nFor each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\nFlip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical.\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

    "text": "Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes\n… says the Buzzfeed article. Let’s see if that’s true.\nFirst, we’ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. We’ll use the mutate() function for this. The following pipeline mutates the nobel_living data frame by adding a new variable called country_us. We use an if statement to create this variable. The first argument in the if_else() function we’re using to write this if statement is the condition we’re testing for. If country is equal to \"USA\", we set country_us to \"USA\". If not, we set the country_us to \"Other\".\nNote: we can achieve the same result using the fct_other() function we’ve seen before (i.e. with country_us = fct_other(country, \"USA\")). We decided to use the if_else() here to show you one example of an if statement in R.\n\nnobel_living &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\nnobel_living_science &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n\nFor the next exercise work with the nobel_living_science data frame you created above.\n\nCreate a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize. Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\nYour visualization should be faceted by category.\nFor each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\nFlip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical."

Well, the late comedian Mitch Hedberg thinks it’s Spanish for next to Denny’s.\nIf you’re not familiar with these two establishments, Denny’s is a casual diner chain that is open 24 hours and La Quinta Inn and Suites is a hotel chain.\nThese two establishments tend to be clustered together, or at least this observation is a joke made famous by Mitch Hedberg. In this lab we explore the validity of this joke and along the way learn some more data wrangling and tips for visualizing spatial data.\nThe inspiration for this comes from a blog post by John Reiser on his new jersey geographer blog. You can read that analysis here. Reiser’s blog post focuses on scraping data from Denny’s and La Quinta Inn and Suites websites using Python. Here, we focus on visualization and analysis of these data."

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nNote: A percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: Wikipedia\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\n\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\nWe use the ggplot() function to do this. The first argument is the data frame, and the next argument gives the mapping of the variables of the data to the aesthetic elements of the plot.\nLet’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the plot, we get a message:\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nThis is telling us that we might want to reconsider the binwidth we chose for our histogram – or more accurately, the binwidth we didn’t specify. It’s good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth. You might ask yourself: “What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?” $1 is obviously too little, $10000 might be too high.\n\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\n\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n    min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000\n\n\n\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nNow that we’ve seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  group_by(major_category) %&gt;%\n  summarise(___ = ___(median)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(___)\n\n\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample? To answer this question we use a new function called count, which first groups the data and then counts the number of observations in each category (see below). Add to the pipeline appropriately to arrange the results so that the major with the lowest observations is on top.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  count(major_category)\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 2\n   major_category                          n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                               &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Agriculture & Natural Resources        10\n 2 Arts                                    8\n 3 Biology & Life Science                 14\n 4 Business                               13\n 5 Communications & Journalism             4\n 6 Computers & Mathematics                11\n 7 Education                              16\n 8 Engineering                            29\n 9 Health                                 12\n10 Humanities & Liberal Arts              15\n11 Industrial Arts & Consumer Services     7\n12 Interdisciplinary                       1\n13 Law & Public Policy                     5\n14 Physical Sciences                      10\n15 Psychology & Social Work                9\n16 Social Science                          9"
