Sometimes things will go swimmingly, and sometimes you’ll run into merge conflicts. So our first task today is to walk you through a merge conflict!\n\nPushing to a repo replaces the code on GitHub with the code you have on your computer.\nIf a collaborator has made a change to your repo on GitHub that you haven’t incorporated into your local work, GitHub will stop you from pushing to the repo because this could overwrite your collaborator’s work!\nSo you need to explicitly “merge” your collaborator’s work before you can push.\nIf your and your collaborator’s changes are in different files or in different parts of the same file, git merges the work for you automatically when you *pull*.\nIf you both changed the same part of a file, git will produce a **merge conflict** because it doesn’t know how which change you want to keep and which change you want to overwrite.\n\nGit will put conflict markers in your code that look like:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD \n\nSee also: [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)   \n\n======= \n\nSee also [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some1alpha2numeric3string4\nThe ===s separate your changes (top) from their changes (bottom).\nNote that on top you see the word HEAD, which indicates that these are your changes.\nAnd at the bottom you see some1alpha2numeric3string4 (well, it probably looks more like 28e7b2ceb39972085a0860892062810fb812a08f).\nThis is the hash (a unique identifier) of the commit your collaborator made with the conflicting change.\nYour job is to reconcile the changes: edit the file so that it incorporates the best of both versions and delete the &lt;&lt;&lt;, ===, and &gt;&gt;&gt; lines. Then you can stage and commit the result."

    "text": "Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes\n… says the Buzzfeed article. Let’s see if that’s true.\nFirst, we’ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. We’ll use the mutate() function for this. The following pipeline mutates the nobel_living data frame by adding a new variable called country_us. We use an if statement to create this variable. The first argument in the if_else() function we’re using to write this if statement is the condition we’re testing for. If country is equal to \"USA\", we set country_us to \"USA\". If not, we set the country_us to \"Other\".\n\nNote that we can achieve the same result using the `fct_other()` function we've seen before (i.e. with `country_us = fct_other(country, \"USA\")`). We decided to use the `if_else()` here to show you one example of an if statement in R.\n\n\nnobel_living &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\nnobel_living_science &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n\nFor the next exercise work with the nobel_living_science data frame you created above. This means you’ll need to define this data frame in your R Markdown document, even though the next exercise doesn’t explicitly ask you to do so.\n\nCreate a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize. Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\nYour visualization should be faceted by category.\nFor each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\nFlip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical.\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

    "text": "Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes\n… says the Buzzfeed article. Let’s see if that’s true.\nFirst, we’ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. We’ll use the mutate() function for this. The following pipeline mutates the nobel_living data frame by adding a new variable called country_us. We use an if statement to create this variable. The first argument in the if_else() function we’re using to write this if statement is the condition we’re testing for. If country is equal to \"USA\", we set country_us to \"USA\". If not, we set the country_us to \"Other\".\nNote: we can achieve the same result using the fct_other() function we’ve seen before (i.e. with country_us = fct_other(country, \"USA\")). We decided to use the if_else() here to show you one example of an if statement in R.\n\nnobel_living &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\nnobel_living_science &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n\nFor the next exercise work with the nobel_living_science data frame you created above.\n\nCreate a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize. Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\nYour visualization should be faceted by category.\nFor each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\nFlip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical."

How many of the winners are born in the US?\nAdd a second variable to your visualization from Exercise 3 based on whether the laureate was born in the US or not. Based on your visualization, do the data appear to support Buzzfeed’s claim? Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.\n\nYour final visualization should contain a facet for each category.\nWithin each facet, there should be a bar for whether the laureate won the award in the US or not.\nEach bar should have segments for whether the laureate was born in the US or not."

Which country is the most common?"
