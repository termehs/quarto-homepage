title: Data Science with Tidyverse II
subtitle: Tidymodeling
description: |
  The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling using tidyverse principles. This course introduces the principles and practices of predictive modeling using this framework in R. Designed for learners with R knowledge, the course emphasizes building, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models in a tidy and reproducible manner. Students will gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation, using real-world datasets. The course consists of two parts, one introductory and one more advanced. These parts are combianed with several case studies for more practice.
